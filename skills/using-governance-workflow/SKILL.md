# Using Governance Workflow

Use this as the router skill for the workflow pack.

## Route

| Situation | Load next |
| --- | --- |
| Empty folder or missing root governance | `initializing-governance-repo` |
| Source product document needs import | `archiving-product-document` |
| PRD exists but product chapters are missing | `structuring-product-requirements` |
| Product is structured and design is needed | `designing-system-architecture`, then `designing-api-contracts` |
| Any phase claims completion | `verifying-governance-docs` |

## Rules

- Do not derive design from an unarchived product source.
- Do not continue past a blocking item in `docs/unresolved.md`.
- Do not create a new docs directory unless it is registered in `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- Prefer scripts for deterministic checks; use skills for judgment-heavy classification.
- After initialization, prefer the target-local `bin/governance` runtime copied into the generated repository.
